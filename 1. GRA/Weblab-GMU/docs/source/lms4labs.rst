lms4labs
========

`lms4labs <http://github.com/lms4labs>`_ is a joint open effort towards creating
a generic tool for integrating different remote laboratories in different
Learning Management Systems. At this moment, contributors are from the
`University of Deusto <http://www.deusto.es>`_, `Massachusetts Institute of
Technology <http://www.mit.edu>`_ and `UNED <http://www.uned.es>`_. 

The system right now works with WebLab-Deusto, and ongoing work is focused on
supporting MIT iLabs. In the current version, it supports Moodle 1.9, Moodle 2.x
and .LRN, but it is easily extensible for other management systems. Right now,
ongoing work is focused on supporting the IMS LTI standard.

Refer to the `lms4labs documentation
<http://lms4labs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ for further information. The
approach taken from the WebLab-Deusto perspective, is the one described in the
:ref:`federation for external tools section <external_tools_federation>`.
