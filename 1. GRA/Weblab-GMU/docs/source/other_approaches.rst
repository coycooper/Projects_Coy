Other approaches
================

So as to consume WebLab-Deusto laboratories from external tools, the best and
recommended way is to use the :ref:`federation system
<external_tools_federation>`. However, it is also possible to support external
tools through other schemes, such as OpenID or OAuth 2.0 for authentication.
Documentation regarding these systems is available in the :ref:`authentication
section <authentication>`.
