Summary
=======

`WebLab-Deusto <http://www.weblab.deusto.es>`_ is an Open Source 
(`BSD 2-clause license <http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause>`_) remote 
laboratory management system developed in the 
`University of Deusto <http://www.deusto.es>`_. A remote laboratory is a 
software and hardware solution that enables students to access equipment which 
is physically located in a university, secondary school or research centre.  
There are many types of remote laboratories (for physics, chemistry, 
electronics...). What WebLab-Deusto does is:

#. provide a set of APIs to develop new remote laboratories.
#. maintain remote laboratories developed on top of WebLab-Deusto: manage users,
   permissions, user tracking, scheduling, etc.
#. share remote laboratories developed on top of WebLab-Deusto: let other
   universities or secondary schools use your laboratories.
#. use remote laboratories provided by other universities (such as the
   University of Deusto).
