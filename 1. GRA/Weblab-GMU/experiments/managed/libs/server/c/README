*** C EXPERIMENT SERVER LIBRARY ***

This library can be used to easily implement new experiments using the C++
programming language.

Currently the library has been tested on Windows using Cygwin.

Nonetheless, the library should compile on any standard C++ compiler, as long as
the libraries it depends on are available (mainly xmlrpc-c, see below).


*** USING THE LIBRARY ON WINDOWS WITH CYGWIN ***

New experiments can be based on the dummy_experiment_server.c example.

In order to do this, you will need to assign the right functions to the
server struct.


*** COMPILING & DEPENDENCIES ***

This library depends on the xmlrpc-c library. Though theorethically you should
be able to use any version of it, older versions may lead to some trouble.


*** KNOWN BUGS ***

Seems to crash under certain situations, especially if there are a high number
of simultaneous connections to the server.



*** STEP BY STEP GUIDE FOR CYGWIN ***

1) Get the xmlrpc-c library and place it somewhere.

2) Open cygwin. Previously, make sure that all necessary tools are installed. This includes GNU make and the g++ compiler.

3) Go to the xmlrpc-c folder and make and install it in the usual way:
	./configure
	make
	make install
	
4) Ensure that your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH environment variables are set properly. Particularly, they should point to /usr/local/lib, 
   where the xmlrpc-c binaries will be placed. This will make it possible to link xmlrpc through the standard "gcc -lxmlrpc ..."
   
5) Build your experiment server, using the DummyExperimentServer as base.

6) Use the provided makefile to build your experiment server, using:
	make all
	
7) You will need cygwin1.dll to run the .exe.
