WindowsVMService.exe is the software required to change the RDP or VNC password remotely. 

Because it is a service and not an application, it must be explicitally installed as such before use. 

This can be done automatically through the sc_install_service.bat or alternatively through the install_service.bat scripts.
Two different scripts are provided in case a particular OS version / system has issues with one.

Once installed, it will have been added to the service list and it can be managed through the standard windows Service Manager.
Alternatively, we provide sc_start_service.bat and sc_stop_service.bat scripts for convenience. Note that those scripts will
often only work as intended if the service was installed through the sc_install_service script.


Before starting the service, please make sure that it has been configured properly through the WindowsVMService.exe.config file.
Particularly, the account name specified in the .config file should match the name of the account whose passwords you want to
be changed. This will generally be the same account under which you are installing the service, but not necessarily. You will
also want to choose the method or methods whose passwords you wish the service to manage.
