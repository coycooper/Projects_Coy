            <p>This is the WebLab-Deusto creation wizard. With it, you can automatically generate
                your own WebLab-Deusto system, on which you can manage your users, grant them permissions
                on certain laboratories, etc.</p>

            <p>The process is very simple: click on the <i><a href="{{ url_for('configure') }}">Configure</a></i> tab
                and fill the data related to your institution (university, secondary school, etc.). Then, click on the
                <i><a href="{{ url_for('deploy') }}">Deploy</a></i> tab to fill the administrator data and deploy the
                system.
                Once deployed, you will be able to modify users (including the administrator data) and permissions, but
                not
                the parameters provided in the <i>Configure</i> panel. You may however change those by contacting us.
            </p>

            <p>Enjoy!</p>
