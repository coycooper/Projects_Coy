1. The project of my Graduate Research Assisstant in Spring semester, 2017:
   This project is aimed at building an online remote access weblab in which students can access and do the experiments online through their laptop or smart phone. I am the only person who is in charge of building Core Server, Laboratory Server and Experiment Server, using Python. Some of APIs are programmed by Java Script. Most of source codes are Python code. This is my first formal job, involving into a real big project. Absolutely, I did learn something from it, like how to search the relative article, like how to use Python (in order to finish it, I just started programming Python from Spring, 2017), like how to cooperate with other teammates, and so on.
