2. This is a tricky project I've ever done. It's about predicting powerball:
   During Fall, 2013, there was a boss finding me, and hired me to design a mathematical model for him to predict the outcome of Powerball. After I built up the model, using C++ at that time, I took about two month time to programmed for that. When I thought I had everything done in a right way, I presented to this boss. I got a relatively good result at that time, but the risk was too high. For example, although in 3-year-period(I used some data as training data, and the rest as testing data), the rate of return is pretty high, the boss wasn't willing to pay hundreds thousand dollar at once to take this risk. If we are not lucky enough and lost the most of money at first try, it will be very hard for us to survive in such a cruel game. Therefore, he asked me to do a risk avoiding modula, even it may reduce some revenue. However, after that, I came to The United States, and I didn't have too much time to revise it.
   For here, I will only put part of my prediction data without any model declare and source code.
