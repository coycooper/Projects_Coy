3. CS-504, Principles of Data Management and Mining, Fall, 2016:
   The final project I did for this course is using Python to do KNN and CF analyzing, using the dataset from Grouplens. The dataset is about 20 million ratings and 465,000 tag applications applied to 27,000 movies by 138,000 users. For this project, I am not like most of other students who simply import the library of Numpy and scipy. Because the scale of dataset is really huge, without any constrains, just directly using the functions from the imported library will lead to a very long running time.
   To fix this problem, I added many constrains in my code, and programmed every single part by myself own. It took me about only half an hour to read the data and build a Similarity matrix with all correct results, which is much more efficient than other students did even instructor. This result really impressed my instructor, he gave me a A+ at last. I not only improved the time complexity, but I also get the correct output.
   This is a computer science course about machine learning. In this Course, I also learn how to use SQL in Oracle, NoSQL in MongoDB, and Clustering in Weka.
