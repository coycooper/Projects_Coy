4. STAT-515, Applied Statistics & Visualization for Analytics, Fall, 2015: (My part is from page 12 to 29 in the report. The report is only 29 pages totally.)
   The finaly project for this course is to focuse on foreign trade data to analyze various aspects of foreign trade for the past 15 years. Foreign trade is the official source for U.S. export and import statistics and responsible for issuing regulations governing the reporting of all export shipments from the United States (Census.gov).
   Withing this project, I am in charge of Data Visualization, the most difficult part in this course. The models I built for this project are "Albers equal area conic projection" and "MicromapST", which can analyze the data altogether and all separately amount different specify states. 
   Again, page 12 to page 29 in the report is my part.
